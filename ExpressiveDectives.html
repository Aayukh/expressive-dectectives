<p style="font-family:verdana;","color:yellow;"> Xiaomi mi mix specification </p>
       <p style="font-family:verdana;","color:yellow;">The Mix 4 is the first smartphone from Xiaomi with a front camera under the display. The glass and ceramics clad 6.67-inch smartphone offers additional purchase arguments with its high-end Snapdragon 888+ SoC, up to 12 GB of RAM, an AMOLED panel, and a triple-camera system with 108 MP. In addition, there is also quick charging at 120 watts, recharging the battery in less than 30 minutes.
With the Mix 4, Xiaomi introduces a new high-end smartphone with impressive-sounding hardware equipment. The 6.67-inch Mix 4 has one of the fastest mobile SoCs with the Snapdragon 888+ 5G. In addition, there are a 120-Hz AMOLED panel, up to 12 GB RAM and 512 GB storage, a 120-Watt charger offering quick charging, and 50-Watt wireless charging. The camera also shows some high-end ambitions with the 108-MP Samsung Isocell HMX1 as the main sensor.
<br>
But this isn't all, and the camera offers another interesting detail. The Mix 4 is the first Xiaomi smartphone with a front camera that is hidden under the screen. It has a 20-MP resolution and goes completely without any notch or pop-up mechanics. However, this isn't a completely new feature, since other smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy Fold 3 and ZTE Axon 30 also offer an under-display camera.
<br>
Officially, the Xiaomi Mix 4 is only available in China, but you can also get it in Germany from importers such as TradingShenzhen who provided us with our test unit. We find out in this test how well the Mix 4 fares against the current high-end competitors and whether its under-display camera also does a good job in practice.</p>
